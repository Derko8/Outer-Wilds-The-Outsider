...is a story and puzzle mod that takes place on Dark Bramble, and is intended to be played after finishing the base game and Echoes of the Eye.

IMPORTANT: There are no other mods required, so it is recommended you play with just The Outsider enabled. Make sure New Horizons is disabled, as it causes bugs.

Length: ~3 Hours (if you do everything)

How to start: Just head over to Dark Bramble and start exploring the various new structures! I hope you enjoy the mod!
