...is a quite large story and puzzle mod that takes place on Dark Bramble!

It is intended to be played after finishing the base game and Echoes of the Eye, and it expects you to be paying attention.

On this new journey, you will find the writings of a Nomai who seperated from the rest of the clan.

For best performance, it is recommended you play with just this mod enabled (there are no required mods).
